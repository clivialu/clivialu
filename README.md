## Research Projects & Papers

I maintain a separate GitHub repository for most of my research projects. Each repo usually includes:
- A short, plain-language summary of the paper
- Links to the published article or preprint

- **Lu, J., Yu, D., Mahmoudian, F., Nazari, J. A., & Herremans, I. M. (2024). The influence of board interlocks and sustainability experience on transparent sustainability disclosure**  
  _Business Strategy and the Environment, 33(5)_  
  _(ABDC A; Impact factor 13.3)_  
  This paper examines how board interlocks—links among directors across different companies—and directors’ sustainability experience shape the level of transparency in firms’ sustainability reporting. 
  We find that firms with directors who are connected to other sustainability-focused boards and who have prior sustainability experience tend to disclose sustainability information more openly and consistently.

 - **Lu, J., Rodenburg, K., Foti, L., & Pegoraro, A. (2022). Are firms with better sustainability performance more resilient during crises**  
  _Business Strategy and the Environment, 31(7)_  
  _(ABDC A; Impact factor 13.3)_

  In this study, we examine whether companies with stronger sustainability performance are better able to withstand periods of crisis. We compare firms’ sustainability performance and their financial                      resilience during disruptive events, showing that firms with stronger sustainability profiles tend to be more resilient when conditions become unstable.
