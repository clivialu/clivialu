### Selected Projects
## ABDC A* Level
- **Mahmoudian, F., Lu, J., Yu, D., Nazari, J. A., & Herremans, I. M. (2021). Inter- and intra-organizational stakeholder arrangements in carbon management accounting**  
  _The British Accounting Review_  
  _(ABDC A*; Impact factor 9.4)_  
  This paper investigates how relationships among stakeholders, both within firms and across organizational boundaries influence carbon management accounting practices. Drawing on stakeholder theory and empirical data, the study shows that effective collaboration and information sharing between internal and external stakeholders improve the integration of carbon management into accounting systems, supporting more strategic and transparent climate-related decision-making.

## ABDC A Level
- **Lu, J., Yu, D., Mahmoudian, F., Nazari, J. A., & Herremans, I. M. (2024). The influence of board interlocks and sustainability experience on transparent sustainability disclosure**  
  _Business Strategy and the Environment, 33(5)_  
  _(ABDC A; Impact factor 13.3)_  
  This paper examines how board interlocks, links among directors across different companies and directors’ sustainability experience shape the level of transparency in firms’ sustainability reporting. 
  We find that firms with directors who are connected to other sustainability-focused boards and who have prior sustainability experience tend to disclose sustainability information more openly and consistently.

- **Lu, J., Rodenburg, K., Foti, L., & Pegoraro, A. (2022). Are firms with better sustainability performance more resilient during crises**  
  _Business Strategy and the Environment, 31(7)_  
  _(ABDC A; Impact factor 13.3)_  
  This paper investigates whether firms with stronger sustainability performance are more resilient when facing crises. Using data on sustainability indicators and firm performance during turbulent periods, we find that companies with higher sustainability scores tend to recover faster and perform more steadily under crisis conditions. These results suggest that sustainability can act as a strategic capability that enhances organizational resilience.

- **Lu, J., Mahmoudian, F., Yu, D., Nazari, J. A., & Herremans, I. M. (2021). Board interlocks, absorptive capacity and environmental performance**  
  _Business Strategy and the Environment, 30(8)_  
  _(ABDC A; Impact factor 13.3)_  
  This study explores how companies’ connections through shared board members (board interlocks) influence their ability to learn from others and how this, in turn, affects their environmental performance. We find that firms connected to others with strong environmental practices tend to improve their own environmental performance when they have the internal capacity to absorb and apply that knowledge.

- **Lu, J., & Wang, J. (2021). Corporate governance, law, culture, environmental performance and CSR disclosure: A global perspective**  
  _Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions & Money, 70_  
  _(ABDC A; Impact factor 4.211)_  
  This paper examines how national governance systems, legal frameworks, and cultural values shape firms’ environmental performance and corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure practices across countries. Using global panel data, the study finds that stronger governance quality and rule of law are associated with higher CSR transparency, while cultural factors moderate how corporate governance translates into sustainability outcomes.

- **Lu, J., Yu, D., Mahmoudian, F., Nazari, J. A., & Herremans, I. M. (2021). Board interlocks and greenhouse gas emissions**  
  _Business Strategy and the Environment, 30(1)_  
  _(ABDC A; Impact factor 13.3)_  
  This study examines how board interlocks, the connections created when directors sit on multiple company boards influence firms’ greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The results show that interlocked boards can serve as channels for spreading environmental awareness and best practices, leading to lower corporate emissions, especially when linked to firms with strong sustainability performance.

- **Lu, J., & Herremans, I. M. (2019). Board gender diversity and environmental performance: An industries perspective**  
  _Business Strategy and the Environment, 28(7), 1449–1464_  
  _(ABDC A; Impact factor 13.3)_  
  This paper examines how gender diversity on corporate boards influences firms’ environmental performance across different industries. Using data from U.S. firms and propensity score matching, the study finds that companies with more gender-diverse boards tend to achieve higher environmental performance, though the strength of this relationship varies by industry context.

- **Herremans, I., Pyasi, N., & Lu, J. (2011). The journey toward sustainability reporting: How accountable are the tourism industries?**  
  _Tourism Recreation Research, 36(3), 247–257_  
  _(ABDC A; Impact score 3.03)_  
  This paper explores how tourism and hospitality companies have progressed in adopting sustainability reporting practices. By analyzing industry reports and disclosure patterns, the study identifies key gaps in accountability, transparency, and stakeholder engagement. The findings reveal that while awareness of sustainability has increased, consistent and comparable reporting remains limited across the tourism sector.

## ABDC B Level
- **Lu, J., & Khan, S. (2023). Are sustainable firms more profitable during COVID-19? Recent global evidence of firms in developed and emerging economies**  
  _Asian Review of Accounting, 31(1), 57–85_  
  _(ABDC B)_  
  This paper investigates whether firms with stronger sustainability performance were more profitable during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data from both developed and emerging economies, the study finds that sustainability-oriented firms exhibited greater financial resilience and profitability during the crisis, particularly where stakeholder protection and governance institutions were strong.

- **Mahmoudian, F., Lu, J., Yu, D., Nazari, J. A., & Herremans, I. M. (2023). Do creditors value greenhouse gas emissions reduction and disclosure**  
  _Journal of International Accounting, Auditing and Taxation, 52, 100563_  
  _(ABDC B)_  
  This paper investigates whether firms’ efforts to reduce and disclose greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions influence how creditors assess their risk and lending terms. Using international data, the study finds that transparent emissions disclosure and actual reductions in GHG intensity are associated with more favorable credit conditions, suggesting that environmental accountability can lower perceived financial risk.

## ABDC C Level
- **Lu, J., & Jagoda, K. (2023). Sentiment analysis in sustainability accounting reporting: Does the tone reveal future environmental performance?**  
  _International Journal of Accounting and Finance, 11(3), 202–219_  
  _(ABDC C)_  
  This study applies sentiment analysis to sustainability reports to explore whether the tone of firms’ sustainability disclosures predicts their future environmental performance. The results indicate that a more positive and confident tone in sustainability reporting is linked to better subsequent environmental outcomes, suggesting that linguistic cues in corporate reports can reveal meaningful signals about a firm’s future sustainability behavior.

## SJR Q3 Level
- **Hayes, L., Lu, J., & Rezania, D. (2022). An empirical examination of the relationship between capability maturity and firm performance across manufacturing and IT industries**  
  _Management and Production Engineering Review, 13_  
  _(SJR Q3)_  
  This paper empirically examines how capability maturity, reflecting the sophistication of an organization’s management processes relates to firm performance in manufacturing and IT sectors. The results suggest that higher capability maturity is associated with stronger operational efficiency and financial outcomes, though the relationship varies by industry context.
